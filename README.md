# SVBAudioKit

SVBAudioKit provides a small layer above `AVAudioPlayer` and `AVAudioRecorder` which I used in my app [Showmaster](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/showmaster-create-your-own/id717633885?l=en&mt=8). It's not as feature rich as the AVFoundation counterpart but it provides basic functionality and is easy to use.  

## Requirements
- iOS 8.0
- Swift 2.0

### Manually
1. Clone this repo and the `SVBAudioKit.xcodeproj` to your project
